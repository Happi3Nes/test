        <h2>Mini Games</h2>
        <p class="card-ex">
            A minigame (also spelled mini 
            game and mini-game, sometimes called 
            a subgame or microgame) is a short game often contained within another video game. A minigame contains different gameplay elements, and is often smaller or more simplistic, than the game in which it is contained. Some video games consist entirely of minigames which tie into an overall theme, such Olympic Decathlon from 1980. Minigames are also used to represent a specific experience, such as hacking or lock 
            picking or scanning an area, that ties into a larger game.

                ors (also known as Rochambeau, Roshambo, or Janken) is a fun and easy hand game that anyone can learn and enjoy. It’s a great way to make minor decisions when you and a friend can’t agree on something, or even just an entertaining way to pass the time. The neat thing about the game is that almost anybody can pick the rules up in a matter of seconds. In this article, we’ll break the game down so tha
                t you and a friend can play whenever you’d like</p>

            <p class="card-ex">There are several ways to guess a number, including the following1234:
                Ask your audience to choose a number between 1 and 10. Tell them to multiply their number by 9. Ask them to add the first and secon
                d digit of their new number together. Get them to add 4 to their new number. Now, shock them with the final result!
                Ask your friend to pick a number. Have your friend double the number. Show him 10 fingers. Divide the answer by 2. Subtract the original number. Announce that the answer is 5</p>

            <p class="card-ex">A digital clock is a type of cl
                ock that displays the time digitally (i.e. in numerals or other symbols), as opposed to an analogue clock.

                Digital clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the "digital" description refers only to the display, not to the drive mechanism. (Both analogue and digital clocks can be driven either mechanically or electronically, but "
                clockwork" mechanisms with digital displays are rare).</p>

            <p class="card-ex">A website (als
                o written a
                s a web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment or social networking. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page. As of December 2022, the top 5 most visited websites are Google Search, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

                All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network, such as a company's internal website for its employees. Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these devices is called a web browser.</p>
